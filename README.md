**spla** is a sparse linear algebra framework for multi-GPU computations. It provides 
linear algebra primitives, such as matrices, vectors and scalars, supports wide variety of operations, and gives an 
ability to customize underlying values types and parametrise operations using arbitrary user defined functions.

### Platforms

- Windows 10
- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04)
- MacOS (Catalina 10.15)

## Building from sources

### Prerequisites

- Common:
    - Git (to get source code)
    - CMake (the latest version)
    - Ninja (as build files generator)
    - OpenCL 1.2+ SDK
    - Cuda SDK
    - Python 3.7+
- Windows 10:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler (MSVC) with C++ 17 support
    - x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS
- Ubuntu 20.04:
    - GNU C++ Compiler with C++ 17 support
- MaсOS Catalina 10.15:
    - Clang Compiler with C++ 17 support

### Get source code

The following code snippet downloads project source code repository, enters project root folder and runs submodules init
in order to get dependencies source code initialized. Must be executed from the folder where you want to locate project.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/spla.git
$ cd spla
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Configure and run build

The following code snippet runs cmake build configuration process with output into `build` directory, in `Release` mode
with tests `SPLA_BUILD_TESTS=ON` enabled. Then runs build process for `build` directory in verbose mode with `-j 4` four
system threads. Pass optionally `SPLA_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF` to disable build of library example applications. Must be
executed from project root folder.

```shell
$ cmake . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSPLA_BUILD_TESTS=ON
$ cmake --build build --target all --verbose -j 4
```

On macOS, you can optionally specify target binaries architecture to build. Pass option `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES`
with `x86_64` or `arm64` respectively. By default, build falls back to `CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` specified architecture.
See example bellow, replace `<arch>` with desired architecture for your build.

```shell
$ cmake . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSPLA_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=<arch>
$ cmake --build build --target all --verbose -j 4
```

### Run unit-tests

The following code snippet executed python script, which allows to run all native C++ library unit-tests, located in
build directory, specified in `--build-dir=build`. Must be executed from project root folder.

```shell
python ./scripts/run_tests.py --build-dir=build
```
